Forecasting is a subfield of [statistics](statistics.md) aimed at predicting the future state of a system given a time-series of observations. 

There are a variety of approaches to building forecasting models, and the performance of different types of models is sensitive to many factors, including but not limited to: temporal resolution and scale, amount of data, and complexity of process.

Some models are based around the process generating the data.
Some are statistical or machine-learning models that do not account for mechanisms.

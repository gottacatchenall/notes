The probability density function (*pdf*) is a [measure](measure.md) of the [probability](probability.md) of an [event](statistical_event.md).

Strictly speaking, the **pdf** only applies to [continuous](continuous.md) distributions. For [discrete](discrete.md) distributions, the equilivent function is called the _probability mass function_.

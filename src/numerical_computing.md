Numerical computing is the use of computational methods to solve mathematical
problems that are not solvable [analytically](analysis.md)

Numerical methods are often used in application of [scientific computing](./scientific_computing.md)


A method often employed in numerical computing is [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](markovchainmontecarlo.md), used to sample from a [distribution](distribution.md).
Many methods revolve around [rejection sampling](rejection_sampling.md), e.g  [Metropolis-Hastings](metropolis_hastings.md) or [Gibbs sampling](gibbs_sampling.md)

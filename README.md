This is collection of notes I have compiled, relating to many fields:
- computer science
- math, probability, stats
- ecology and evolutionary biology
- _"machine learning"_
- and more...

The best place to start is the [index](./_index.md), which contains a list of the major topics. 

I read these notes using [Obsidian.md](), an editor that enables wiki-like linking between documents, as well as neat network visualizations of the notes' structure. 

The goal is to use `mkdocs` to build this into a public site on github too. 

At some point the goal may be to publish this as a public/open knowledge base for research in ecology and evolutionary biology.

A differential equation describes the [dynamics](./dynamics.md) of a system as a function of its derivative, $$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$$. It treats time as [continuous](./continuous.md), as opposed to [difference-equations](./difference_equation.md), which treat time as [discrete](./discrete.md)

A classical example (from [ecology](./ecology.md)) is the [Lotka-Volterra](./lotka_volterra.md) system.

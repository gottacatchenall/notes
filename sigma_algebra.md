A $\sigma$-[algebra](./algebra.md) is a [mathematical](./mathematics.md) structure which describes a set of objects $x$ within a larger superset $X$ where $x_i \Union x_j = \nothing$ for all $i,j$, and $x_i \join x_j$  is $X$. 

This is a very unintuitive definition to say that if you have a set of items, like 
$A = \{A, B, C \}$, any combination of objects the subdivides that total set into subsets where no item is duplicated, e.g. $\{ \{A\}, \{B\}, \{C\} \}$, or $\{\{A,B\}, \{C\}\}$, or $\{\{A\}, \{B, C\}\}$, is a $\sigma$-algebra on set $A$.

The $\sigma$-algebra construct has much use in the context of [probability theory](./probability.md),

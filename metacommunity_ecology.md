Metacommunity ecology is a framework for multi-scale community ecology 
introduced by [[Leibold et al. 2003]](http://todo).


Four paradigms:

1. Species sorting (selection)
2. Patch dynamics (combination of [dispersal](./dispersal) (colonization) and [drift](./drift.md) (extinction))
3. Neutral ([drift](./drift.md) dominated)
4. Mass effect ([dispersal](./dispersal.md) dominated)

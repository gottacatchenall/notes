The **median** is the value of a [distribution](./distribution.md) $x$ defined such that the [cumulative density function](./cdf.md) for that distribution has the property that $F(x) = 0.5$.

More intuitively, it is the value $x$ for which half of the value from a [distribution](./distribution.md) are less than $x$, and half are more.

An algebra is a [mathematical](./mathematics.md) construct that describes a set of [symbols](./symbols.md) and [operations](./operation.md) which form a [syntactically](./syntax.md) coherent set of rules. This enables [deduction](./deduction.md) of theorems that apply to any set of (symbols, operations) that is isomorphic to a given algebra. 

The term "algebra", sometimes called "elementary algebra", is often used to describe the methodology for manipulating equations, typically polynomials or trigonometric terms, under the set of rules defined by the [todo algebra].

Bayesian statistics is a paradigm of [statistics](./statistics.md), typically based around using [Bayes' Theorem](./bayes_theorem.md) to infer the [posterior distribution](./posterior.md) of [parameters](./statistical_parameter.md) given a [model](./statistical_statistical_model.md) and a set of [priors](./prior_distribution.md).

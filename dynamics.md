Dynamical systems is a field of [mathematics](./mathematics.md) associated with the study of how systems change over time. 

These systems are primarily represented as a system of [differential equations](./differential_equation.md).



Sometimes dynamical systems are expressed as [difference equations](./difference_equation.md), where the timepoints are discrete, e.g. $N(t)=f(N(t-1))$. A classic example is the [logistic map](./logistic_map.md).

The cumulative-density function (cdf) is a function that describes the cumulative probabilty that a sample from a given [distribution](./distribution.md) is less than a given value $X$. 

It is (in some cases) possible to define the cdf $F$ using the [probability-density function (pdf)](./pdf.md) $f$ as $$F(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{X} f(x) dx$$

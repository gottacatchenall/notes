The Lotka-Volterra system is a system of coupled [differential equations](./differential_equation.md), originally used to model the behavior of consumer and resource in [community ecology](./community_ecology.md). It is one of the earliest attempts to apply mathematics, in particular [dynamics](./dynamics.md), to [ecology](./ecology.md).

It is also a common object of study when learning [differential equations](./differential_equation.md) or [dynamical systems](./dynamics.md) as under some parameterizations it produces [limit cycles](./limit_cycle.md).

With respect to modern models of [community](./community_ecology.md) [dynamics](./ecological_dynamics.md), Lotka-Volterra can be seen as a broader class of models with varying forms of [functional response](./functional_response.md).

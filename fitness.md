Fitness is a measure used to describe the [expected value](./expected_value.md) of an organisms reproduction as a function of its traits. This measure is either absolute (expected the number of offspring individuals) or relative (the proportion of offspring compared the average trait value in a population).

Relative fitness itself can be computed different ways:
- $w_1 =$
- $f$ which enforces $\bar{w}=1$

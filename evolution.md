Evolution is the process where the composition of a [trait](./trait.md) in a [population](population.md) of [organisms](organism.md) changes over time.

As it relates to change over time, the study of evolution is inherently a study of 
[dynamics](dynamics.md).


# History

## Lamarck

## Darwin




## Mendel and genetics

## The modern synthesis 

Evolution is governed by four fundamental processes:

1. [Drift](./drift.md)
2. [Selection](selection.md)
3. [Mutation](mutation.md)
4. [Dispersal](dispersal.md)

- Neutral Theory 
- Nearly Neutral Theory 


# Modern questions

Phylogenetic inference
- Parsimony
- Max likelihood
- Bayesian

Using data from genomes to find stuff out
- Linkage, selective sweeps
- Using simulation, ABC
- Hybridization, introgression

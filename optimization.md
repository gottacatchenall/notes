An optimization problem (mathematics) is defined as 


Optimization is easiest if the [cost function](./cost_function.md) is [convex](./convex.md).



Method for [non-convex](./concave.md) optimization:
- [simulated annealing](./simulated_annealing.md)
- [stochastic gradient desent](./stochastic_gradient_descent.md)

A ecosystem consists of the organisms and nonliving environment in the same place at the same time. This has obvious scale-dependencies as a definition.

The study of ecosystems is broadly called [ecology](./ecology.md).

[Ecosystem ecology](./ecosystem_ecology.md) in particular is that study of the conbined effect of biotic and abiotic process on ecosystem function. It often, but not always involves [biogeochemistry](./biogeochemisty.md).
